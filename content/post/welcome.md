## Welcome to the NI Tech Community

Firstly, welcome to the community!

While you might feel a little anxious getting to know everyone around here, most of the time we don’t bite. However, in order to make your life a little easier in terms of finding your feet. Here are some things to keep in mind while you’re here.

### Open Discussions

Keep making friends, keep communicating, keep passionate about your interests! As a community, we don’t bite so don’t be afraid to express your opinion. Just keep in mind, we all like to challenge each other!

### House Keeping

There are a few basic rules about NITC :

-   You can’t leave #general - not our choice! But something to keep in mind
-   Remember to toggle your notifications - particularly if you use more then one slack, you can find more information on how to do this on <https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/categories/200111606-Using-Slack>
-   We have a Code of Conduct so be sure to check it out.
