We're a group of friendly folks in the NI Tech Community that hang out at [nitech.slack.com](nitech.slack.com).

### Come Join Us

We are always interested in new members joining. There are no requirements, other than being a real person, and ideally, interested in tech. We have many channels devoted to multiple subjects, from design and development of tech to conferences and diversity. We are building a sustainable, diverse community of people who are interested in growing their skills, experience, community, and industry.

To request an invite, contact a member of the community and request an invitation. If you are unsure of who you can reach out to, feel free to contact [@apoclyps](https://twitter.com/@apoclyps).

### Creating a safe space

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, so please do have a read of our [Code of Conduct]({{< ref "/page/code_of_conduct.md" >}}).
