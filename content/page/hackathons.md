### Thinking of attending?

There are so many good ways to use a hackathon. Are you looking to finally deliver on a project you’ve been dreaming about? Are you looking to learn a new tech stack? Do you just want to network? Are you there to WIN?

You’ll have more control over your experience at the hackathon if you come in with a team pre-formed. Some hackathons have Slack channels, Facebook groups, etc. set up prior the event, which can be a great way to find teammates. A lot of people will form teams when they arrive at a hackathon, so it's worth attending even without an existing team.
